# CSCI 5448 Grad Project: Object Oriented Programming Based Game Design: Java vs Python 
By: Grayson Hubbell & Yuri Fung

## Graduate Research Paper

The acoompyning paper for this project can be found in the `hubbell_fung_grad_proj.pdf` file. This paper includes a detailed compare and contrast between Java and Python for game development with a lens toward object-oriented game development.

## Java Implementation

To explore OOP based game development, we built the game snake using Java and LibGDX. The implementation focuses on SOLID development and was written with a preference toward future expansion. The game is designed with a flexible implementaion so new features can easily be added. For more information about the Java implemenetaion and how to run the Java snake game, please refer to the `README.md` within the `Java` folder.

## Python Implementation

To compare the enforced SOLID principles of Java to the more flexible OOP that Python uses, we developed a nearly equivalent snake game in Python. The Python implementation follows the best practices of Pygame, not necesarily of OOP, and as such has pros and cons, which we discuss generally in our paper. The Python implementation has some additional features compared to Java, but it also has reduced flexibiliy and the code is more complex, despite the easier to read and program language. For more details on the Python implemnetation and how to run the snake game, please refer to the `README.md` within the `Python` folder. There is also additional technical information in the `Snake.md` file.
